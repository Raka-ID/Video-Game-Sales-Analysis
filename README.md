# Video Game Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes video game sales data across different platforms and regions. It explores trends, platform-specific performance, regional publisher dominance, and implications for game developers in optimizing distribution and marketing strategies.

## Key Findings
1. **Platform Performance**: Console sales peak within 5â€“10 years, while PC sales remain stable long-term.
2. **Multi-Platform Strategy**: Games released on 2-4 platforms have the highest frequency, but more platforms can boost sales reach.
3. **Regional Preferences**: Nintendo leads globally and in Japan; EA dominates Europe with sports titles.
4.  **Genre Preferences**: 
   - **North America**: Action and Sports genres lead, with strong sales for Shooter games.
   - **Europe**: Similar to North America, Action and Sports dominate, followed by Shooter.
   - **Japan**: Role-Playing Games (RPGs) are significantly popular, reflecting cultural preferences for storytelling.
   - **Other Regions**: Action and Sports remain popular, but with a slightly more diverse genre interest.

## Implications for Developers
- Focus on platform optimization and regional adaptations.
- Adapt genre development based on regional preferences (e.g., RPGs in Japan, Sports in Europe).
- Consider gradual multi-platform expansion based on market response.
